### **Slide 1: Availability Sets**

#### Speaker Notes:

**Opening Talking Points:**

* "Let’s begin by understanding one of the older high availability patterns in Azure—Availability Sets."
* "This model spreads virtual machines across multiple **fault domains** and **update domains** within a single datacenter."

**Real-World Context:**

* "Think of fault domains like separate physical racks in a data center. If one rack fails—due to power, network, or hardware—your service doesn’t go down if your VMs are distributed properly."
* "Update domains help protect you from platform updates. Azure staggers reboots during planned maintenance."
* "However—note this key drawback: **Availability Sets do not provide live migration.** If a host needs maintenance, your VM is rebooted."

**Instructor Cues:**

* Ask: *“Have any of you dealt with unexpected VM reboots in Azure? Did you use Availability Sets to mitigate the risk?”*
* Reinforce: *“This is a legacy approach and less flexible than newer models like Availability Zones or VM Scale Sets—but still relevant for lift-and-shift workloads.”*

### **Slide 2: Availability Sets (Design Guidance)**

#### Speaker Notes:

**Talking Points:**

* "To achieve high availability, Microsoft recommends placing **at least two** VMs in an availability set."
* "Azure will automatically place those VMs across **three fault domains** and **five update domains**, by default."

**Real-World Context:**

* "This is a big deal for SLA guarantees. If you only have one VM, there’s **no SLA**. But with at least two VMs in an availability set, you get a **99.95% SLA**."
* "It’s an easy design win—duplicate your workloads and spread them across domains."

**Instructor Cues:**

* Ask: *“How many of you currently deploy VMs in Availability Sets? Do you size for SLA or just functionality?”*
* Emphasize: *“If you’re deploying line-of-business apps that can’t tolerate downtime, this design is your baseline.”*

### **Slide 3: Fault and Update Domains (Visualized)**

#### Speaker Notes:

**Talking Points:**

* "This diagram breaks down **how Azure physically spreads your VMs** across both update and fault domains."
* "You can see each colored block as a physical rack. Inside the racks are **nodes**—individual physical servers."

**Real-World Context:**

* "When you deploy three VMs to an availability set, Azure distributes them across three different racks—**fault domain 0, 1, and 2.**"
* "Then for updates, it further staggers them—placing each VM in different **update domains (UD0–UD4)** to avoid rebooting all VMs at once."

**Instructor Cues:**

* Ask: *“Looking at this layout, what would happen if rack 1 lost power? How many VMs would survive?”*
* Reinforce: *“Fault domain isolation protects you from hardware failure, update domains from platform updates. Together, they reduce downtime risk.”*

---

### **Slide 4: Availability Zones**

#### Speaker Notes:

**Talking Points:**

* "Let’s level up from Availability Sets to **Availability Zones**, or AZs."
* "Zones are physically separated data centers within an Azure region—with **separate power, cooling, and networking.**"

**Real-World Context:**

* "Instead of just spreading across racks in a single building, now we’re spreading VMs across **entire buildings**, often miles apart."
* "VMs deployed across 2+ zones receive a **99.99% SLA**—that’s higher than availability sets."

**Instructor Cues:**

* Ask: *“Anyone here using Availability Zones in production? For what workloads?”*
* Reinforce: *“Each AZ is its own failure domain—so if one zone goes down, your app stays up if it’s properly designed.”*
* Note: *“Unlike sets, zones incur some additional latency. Use load balancers wisely to manage traffic.”*

### **Slide 5: Regions**

#### Speaker Notes:

**Talking Points:**

* "Zooming out further—we have Azure **Regions**, which are broad geographic locations made up of one or more datacenters."
* "Azure has over **60 regions in 140 countries**, making it the most expansive cloud provider in terms of geographic coverage."

**Real-World Context:**

* "Each region is a decision point for latency, data residency, compliance, and redundancy."
* "Many enterprises choose a ‘primary’ and ‘failover’ region—say, `East US` and `Central US`—and pair services accordingly."

**Instructor Cues:**

* Ask: *“Which regions do your orgs typically deploy to—and why? Compliance? Proximity to customers?”*
* Tip: *“Azure regions can differ in features and zone support—always check if your target region supports the services you need.”*

### **Slide 6: Scale Sets**

#### Speaker Notes:

**Opening Talking Points:**

* "Now let’s talk about a **modern alternative** to Availability Sets—**Virtual Machine Scale Sets**, or VMSS."
* "This is Azure’s answer to **horizontal scalability** using identical VMs managed as a group."

**Real-World Context:**

* "Think of a web farm or compute cluster—if traffic spikes, VMSS can automatically **scale out**, and when traffic drops, it **scales in**."
* "You define one VM image—your ‘golden image’—and VMSS can spin up 10, 100, or 1000 VMs from it, with load balancing and autoscale built in."
* "And it supports **rolling updates**, so you can patch or re-image the set without full downtime."

**Instructor Cues:**

* Ask: *“Who here has managed autoscaling groups—either in Azure or in AWS (like EC2 Auto Scaling)?”*
* Tease upcoming lab: *“We’ll deploy a full scale set via Bicep shortly—including diagnostics and an autoscale profile.”*
* Reinforce: *“If you’re building stateless, scalable services—this is your go-to pattern.”*

### **Slide 7: Scale Sets – Managed Deployment & Update Rollout**

#### Speaker Notes:

**Opening Talking Points:**

* "One of the biggest advantages of VM Scale Sets is their ability to manage an entire deployment as a single unit."
* "Updates can be rolled out **incrementally**, without bringing the entire service down."

**Real-World Context:**

* "Imagine a microservice architecture where you’ve got 20 stateless web servers. You can update them one at a time or in batches—**zero downtime deployments** with health checks in place."
* "Behind the scenes, Scale Sets handle the heavy lifting—network, storage, config, and even extensions like monitoring agents."

**Instructor Cues:**

* Ask: *“Who here has had to manage app updates manually across dozens of VMs before?”*
* Emphasize: *“This kind of abstraction is what makes VMSS ideal for production workloads—especially those needing agility and resilience.”*

### **Slide 8: Scale Sets – Limitations**

#### Speaker Notes:

**Talking Points:**

* "Scale Sets are powerful—but like everything in Azure, they have limits you need to be aware of."

**Highlight Key Limits:**

* "You’re limited to **1000 VMs per scale set**, and that’s only if you’re using the **Azure Standard Load Balancer**."
* "You can create **up to 2000 scale sets per region per subscription**—which is usually more than enough."

**Real-World Context:**

* "In practice, 1000 VMs per set is sufficient for most use cases, but in high-scale environments like global SaaS platforms, you’ll hit this ceiling."
* "Design with this in mind if you're building large-scale, horizontally scalable apps."

**Instructor Cues:**

* Ask: *“Any of you ever hit resource limits in Azure—intentionally or by accident?”*
* Tip: *“Azure limits are usually soft—you can submit a support request to increase them if your use case justifies it.”*

### **Slide 9: Auto-scaling Scale Sets**

#### Speaker Notes:

**Opening Talking Points:**

* "Let’s shift focus to one of the most important features—**autoscaling**."

**Talking Points:**

* "Scale Sets can scale on two triggers: **schedule-based** or **metric-based**."
* "You can scale up on specific dates/times—like a scheduled product launch—or reactively based on metrics like CPU usage or queue length."

**Real-World Context:**

* "A retail site might scale up every weekday at 8 a.m., knowing traffic increases before lunch, then back down at night."
* "Alternatively, it might scale dynamically when CPU usage exceeds 70% for 5 minutes—this reactive scaling protects performance."

**Instructor Cues:**

* Ask: *“Would your current workloads benefit more from metric-based or scheduled scaling?”*
* Tip: *“You can combine both—but remember, **scheduled rules take precedence** over metric triggers.”*

### **Slide 10: Pop Quiz – Scale Set Design Scenario**

#### Speaker Notes:

**Talking Points:**

* "Let’s test your understanding with a quick scenario."

**Read Prompt Aloud:**

* "You need high availability in a single region and want to support 200 instances in a scale set. Which option do you choose?"

**Instructor Cues:**

* Ask: *“Raise your hand for each answer—A, B, C, or D. Let’s see what the room thinks before I reveal the answer.”*
* Let participants reason through it—ask why they picked their answer.

**Reinforce Concept:**

* “We’re focusing on both availability and instance count here, so **availability sets** (Option D) don’t scale well."
* “To maintain a larger number of VMs within one region and ensure high availability, you need placement groups.”

---

### **Slide 11: Quiz Answer Explanation**

#### Speaker Notes:

**Talking Points:**

* "The correct answer is **C: Regional scale set with placement groups.**"

**Explain Why:**

* "Placement groups are how Azure internally distributes large-scale deployments to avoid hitting host limits."
* "Zonal sets (Option B) do offer redundancy, but the question specified **single region**—and not all regions support zonal deployment."

**Instructor Cues:**

* Ask: *“Anyone pick something else? What led you there?”*
* Reinforce: *“Always read the scenario carefully—Azure has multiple flavors of VMSS, and knowing when to use each one is critical.”*
